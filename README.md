# MachineLearningProgress

This repository showcases my progress in machine learning, from simple linear regression to more advanced models. Each project includes the dataset, implementation code, and visualizations.

## Projects

### 1. Salary Predictor using Linear Regression
A project to predict employee salaries based on years of experience using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

- Implemented **gradient descent from scratch** for model optimization
- Analyzed data using **Pandas** and **NumPy**
- Visualized predictions vs actual salaries using **Matplotlib**
- Developed a reusable prediction function for arbitrary years of experience
- Evaluated model performance with **MSE** and prediction accuracy
