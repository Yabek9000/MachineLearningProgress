# MachineLearningProgress

This repository showcases my progress in machine learning, from simple linear regression to more advanced models. Each project includes the dataset, implementation code, and visualizations.

## Projects

### 1. Salary Predictor using Linear Regression
A project to predict employee salaries based on years of experience using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

- Implemented gradient descent from scratch for model optimization
- Analyzed data using Pandas and NumPy
- Visualized predictions vs actual salaries using Matplotlib
- Developed a reusable prediction function for arbitrary years of experience
- Evaluated model performance with MSE and prediction accuracy

### 2. Descision Tree for titanic and playing tenis.
A project to predict survival of passangers based on 7 features, and predict if playing tenis based on 2 features.

- Implemented a decision tree algorithm using information gain and entropy calculations.
- Built a recursive tree construction with automatic feature splitting.
- validated custom implementation against scikit-learn, achieved 95.3% accuracy.
- Developed a reusable prediction function for arbitrary years of experience
- Performed feature engineering on 7 features.
- optimized model performance by tuning max_depth and criterion parameters.
